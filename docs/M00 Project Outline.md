Exception Handling (Myles):
Implement exception handling for the entire system.
Create custom exception classes like "InvalidAgeException" and "AppointmentConflictException."


Virtual Functions and Polymorphism (Myles):
Implement virtual functions in the base "Patient" class and override them in derived classes.
Demonstrate polymorphism using STL containers of base class pointers.

Appointment Scheduling (Errol):
Develop the "Appointment" class to represent appointments.
Use STL containers for appointment scheduling, conflict tracking, and managing cancellations or rescheduling.

User Interface (Errol):
Develop the user interface for interacting with the Hospital Management System.
Implement menus, prompts, error messages, and user input validations.



Patient Class Hierarchy (Joseph):
Develop the base class "Patient" and derive the "Inpatient" and "Outpatient" classes.
Implement constructors, destructors, and member functions for each class.


Medical Staff Management (Olivia):
Create classes for different medical staff (Doctor, Nurse).
Utilize STL containers and algorithms to manage medical staff, assign them to appointments, and handle their schedules.


Data Validations (Olivia):
Implement data validations for user inputs, ensuring the integrity of age, appointment time, and other relevant data.
Display appropriate error messages for invalid data.

STL Integration - Data Storage and Manipulation (Olivia):
Utilize appropriate STL containers (vector, list, map) to store and manage patient records.
Implement operations for adding patients, searching based on name or ID, and displaying patient lists using STL algorithms and iterators.

Documentation (All team members):
Collaboratively write the project report with sections covering the overview, class diagrams, implemented functionalities, exception handling, data validations, user interface, and testing.
Each member contributes to specific sections and ensures code comments are added throughout the codebase.

Testing (All team members):
Collaboratively write test cases to validate implemented functionalities.
Document test cases and their expected outcomes in the project report
